         Data mining of internet search queries and social media for influenza
         related keywords  has been used to track seasonal influenza and correlates
         highly with official reports  of `infuenza-like-illness' (ILI). Efforts
         to monitor epidemics using big data analytics  can provide early detection
         that supplements existing systems of disease surveillance.  A review of
         the literature shows that data extracted from social media has applications
          for public health informatics. Prediction models based on social media
         work best in  areas with a high degree of internet access.  n"

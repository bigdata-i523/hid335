        Big Data Analytics, Data Mining, and Public Health
        Informatics: Using Data Mining of Social Media to Track
        Epidemics
    abstract: >
        Data mining of internet search queries and social media for
        influenza related keywords has been used to track seasonal
        influenza and correlates highly with official reports of
        `infuenza-like-illness' (ILI). Efforts to monitor epidemics
        using big data analytics can provide early detection that
        supplements existing systems of disease surveillance.  A
        review of the literature shows that data extracted from social
        media has applications for public health
        informatics. Prediction models based on social media work best
        in areas with a high degree of internet access.

        Big Health Data from Wearable Electronic Sensors (WES) and the Treatment
        of Opioid Addiction
    abstract: >
        Wearable electronic sensors (WES) and mobile health applications can be 
        used to collect vital health data to supplement traditional forms of 
        treatment for opioid addiction and may be used to predict risk factors 
        related to overdose death.

       Machine Learning Classification of Opioid Use and Addiction for Big Data Health Analytics
   abstract: >
       Classification of opioid abuse and dependency can help to identify features relevant 
       to drug addiction and overdose. This project uses machine learning procedures to 
       classify individuals according to illicit opioid use, and identify characteristics 
       of individuals susceptible to opioid addiction. Developing a classification model for
       identifying factors related to opioid addiction could be extended over previous years, 
       to the population of patients who are prescribed opioid medication, to help reduce rates 
       of opioid addiction, and curtain the epidemic of opioid medication abuse. Differences 
       between classification methods will be discussed.

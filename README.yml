        Big Data Analytics, Data Mining, and Public Health Informatics:  
        Using Data Mining of Social Media to Track Epidemics
    abstract: >
         Data mining of internet search queries and social media for influenza
         related keywords  has been used to track seasonal influenza and correlates
         highly with official reports  of `infuenza-like-illness' (ILI). Efforts
         to monitor epidemics using big data analytics  can provide early detection
         that supplements existing systems of disease surveillance.  A review of
         the literature shows that data extracted from social media has applications
          for public health informatics. Prediction models based on social media
         work best in  areas with a high degree of internet access.  n"

       "Big Data and Health Analytics: Using Machine Learning to Predict Opiate Addiction and Overdose"
   abstract: >
       Abuse of prescription medication in North America over the past two decades has lead to 
       increased rates of opioid addiction, drug overdose, and death. Big data health analytics 
       may help to identify individuals susceptible to addiction and overdose, possibly leading 
       to improved treatment and prevention outcomes. This project will explore how machine 
       learning classification methods (logistic regression, decision trees, SVM) applied to 
       public health data can be used to predict opioid addiction and drug overdose. Differences 
       between the ML classification methods will be discussed.

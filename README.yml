        Big Data Analytics, Data Mining, and Public Health
        Informatics: Using Data Mining of Social Media to Track
        Epidemics
    abstract: >
        Data mining of internet search queries and social media for
        influenza related keywords has been used to track seasonal
        influenza and correlates highly with official reports of
        `infuenza-like-illness' (ILI). Efforts to monitor epidemics
        using big data analytics can provide early detection that
        supplements existing systems of disease surveillance.  A
        review of the literature shows that data extracted from social
        media has applications for public health
        informatics. Prediction models based on social media work best
        in areas with a high degree of internet access.

       Big Data and Health Analytics: Using Machine Learning to
       Predict Opiate Addiction and Overdose
   abstract: >
       Abuse of prescription medication in North America over the past
       two decades has lead to increased rates of opioid addiction,
       drug overdose, and death. Big data health analytics may help to
       identify individuals susceptible to addiction and overdose,
       possibly leading to improved treatment and prevention
       outcomes. This project will explore how machine learning
       classification methods (logistic regression, decision trees,
       SVM) applied to public health data can be used to predict
       opioid addiction and drug overdose. Differences between the ML
       classification methods will be discussed.

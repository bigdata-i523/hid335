HID335: Project Proposal 

Title: > 
    Big Data and Health Analytics: Using Machine Learning 
    to Predict Opiate Addiction and Overdose.  

Abstract: >
   Abuse of prescription medication in North America over the past two decades 
   has lead to increased rates of opioid addiction, drug overdose, and death. Big data 
   health analytics may help to identify individuals susceptible to addiction and overdose, 
   possibly leading to improved treatment and prevention outcomes. This project will explore 
   how machine learning classification methods (logistic regression, decision trees, SVM) 
   applied to public health data can be used to predict opioid addiction and drug overdose. 
   Differences between the ML classification methods will be discussed.

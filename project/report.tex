\begin{abstract}
Classification of opioid abuse and dependency can help to identify features
relevant to drug addiction and overdose. This project uses machine learning
procedures to classify individuals according to illicit opioid use, and
identify characteristics of individuals susceptible to opioid addiction.
Developing a classification model for identifying factors related to opioid 
addiction could be extended over previous years, to the population of
patients who are prescribed opioid medication, to help reduce rates of 
opioid addiction, and curtain the epidemic of opioid medication abuse.  
Differences between the classification methods is discussed.

\section{Introduction}

The abuse of prescription opioid medication has become a major health crisis 
in the U.S. that has reached epidemic proportion \cite{volkow14}. Over 2 
million Americans were dependent or abused prescription opioids such as 
oxycodone (i.e. ``Oxycontin'') or hydrocodone (e.g., ``Vicodan'') in 2014 
\cite{cdc17}. Overdose deaths from prescription opioids has quadrupled since 
1999, resulting in more than 180,000 deaths between 1999 to 2015 \cite{nida17}. 
Mobile health applications can help monitor medication adherence and provide 
an early warning system for potential abuse of prescription medication 
\cite{varshney13}. Medication abuse can consist of higher medication dosages 
or rapid escalation of a prescribed dosage. The general goal of this prediction 
model is to analyze patient data for sudden changes in medication consumption;
however, reliable information about medication consumption can be difficult 
to obtain from potentially addicted individuals based on self-reports. 
Individuals dependent or addicted to opioids may seek to obtain medications 
without a prescription, seek synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, or obtain 
illicit drugs such as heroin. The goal of this project was to use machine
learning classification procedures to help identify demographic information 
and features of individuals who are potentially susceptible to opioid 
dependency, abuse, and addiction.Classification of illicit opioid use
could help identify at risk for developing opioid dependency and addiction. 

\subsection{Drug Addiction and Treatment}









Addiction is a complex phenomenon, with multiple and interacting factors. 


Drug addiction chronic health conditions 
Drug addiction has many similar characteristics to other chronic medical 
illnesses; however, there are unique challenges to the treatment of addiction
illnesses \cite{boyer10}. 

For example, drug addicted patients undergo intense detoxification 
in rehabilitation treatment programs, which reduces their drug tolerance, and 
then are released back into the same environment associated with their drug use, 
putting them at greater risk for relapse and potential drug overdose. 


Efforts to address prescription opioid abuse, overdoses, and deaths have 
focused on four major risk areas: (i) Increasing knowledge of opioid abuse 
and improving decisions of medication prescribers, (ii) Reducing inappropriate 
access to opioids, (iii) Increasing effective overdose treatment, (iv) 
Providing substance-abuse treatment to persons addicted to opioids. 


The lack 
of continuity in the treatment of addiction disorders leaves persons in recovery 
at high risk of relapse for substance use and abuse. 

have been proposed. According to the classical conditioning model, situational 
cues or events can elicit a motivational state underlying relapse to drug use. 

A slightly more complex model suggests that addictive behavior can be reinstated 
after extinction of dependency by exposure to drugs, drug-related cues, or 
environmental stressors \cite{shaham03}.

\section{figures}

In Figure \ref{f:fly} 


we show a fly. Please note that because we use
just columwidth that the size of the figure will change to the
columnwidth of the paper once we change the layout to final. CHnaging
the layout to final should not be done by you. All figures will be
listed at the end.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

When copying the example, please do not check in the images from the
examples into your images directory as you will not need them for your
paper. Instead use images that you like to include. If you do not have
any images, do not dreate the images folder.

\section{Tables}

In case you need to create tables, you can do this with online tools
(if you do not mind sharing your data) such as
\url{https://www.tablesgenerator.com/} or other such tools (please
google for them). They even allow you to manage tables as CSV.

or generate them by hand while using the provided template in Table\ref{t:mytable}. Not ethat
the caption is before the tabular environment.

\begin{table}[htb]

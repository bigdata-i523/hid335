       "Big Data Analytics, Data Mining, and Public Health Informatics: 
       Using Data Mining of Social Media to Track Epidemics"
   abstract: >
       Data mining of internet search queries and social media for influenza related keywords 
       has been used to track seasonal influenza and correlates highly with official reports 
       of `infuenza-like-illness' (ILI). Efforts to monitor epidemics using big data analytics 
       can provide early detection that supplements existing systems of disease surveillance. 
       A review of the literature shows that data extracted from social media has applications 
       for public health informatics. Prediction models based on social media work best in 
       areas with a high degree of internet access.

    \DONE{Make the figures large enough so we can read the details. If needed make the figure over two columns}
    \DONE{Do not worry about the figure placement if they are at a different location than you think. Figures are allowed to ﬂoat. For this class, you should place all figures at the end of the report.}
    \DONE{In case you copied a figure from another paper you need to ask for copyright permission. In case of a class paper, you must include a reference to the original in the caption}
    \DONE{Remove any figure that is not referred to explicitly in the text (As shown in Figure ..)}
    \DONE{Do not use textwidth as a parameter for includegraphics}
    \DONE{Figures should be reasonably sized and often you just need to

\section{Introduction}

In the increasingly connected digital age, personal electronic devices are 
generating tremendous volumes of data with important applications for 
health analytics. Wearable electronic sensors (i.e., \emph{wearables}) and
fitness monitors (e.g, FitBit, iWatch) can record our movements and vital 
physiological measures such as heart rate, temperature, and blood pressure 
\cite{metcalf16}. Consumers are using wearables to self-monitor stress 
and hypertension. In addition, wearable sensors can be used to help track
recovery following medical procedures such as surgery \cite{atallah11}. 
Emerging forms of personalized health care are arising in which individuals 
self-monitor and manage their own health in partnership with care providers.

\subsubsection{Drug Addiction as an Illness}

For millions of people struggling with substance abuse and dependency in 
the U.S., addiction and relapse are chronic health conditions \cite{boyer10}. 
Drug addiction has many similar characteristics to other chronic medical 
illnesses; however, there are unique challenges to the treatment of addiction
illnesses. For example, drug addicted patients undergo intense detoxification 
in rehabilitation treatment programs, but then are released back into the same 
environment associated with their drug use. The lack of continuity in the 
treatment of addiction disorders, leaves addicts in recovery at high risk for
relapse into substance use and abuse. Second, individuals with addiction 
disorders present for care to emergency rooms after acute intoxication, often 
following law enforcement interventions. Emergency personal and very capable 
at crisis intervention for drug overdose, but lack resources to evaluate severe 
addiction disorders or provide follow-up. Furthermore, addicted individuals 
seeking treatment often relapse at night or on weekends when treatment centers 
are not open. Various theories of addiction and relapse have been proposed. 
According to the classical conditioning model, situational cues or events can 
elicit a motivational state underlying relapse to drug use. A slightly more 
complex model suggests that addictive behavior can be reinstated after 
extinction of dependency by exposure to drugs, drug-related cues, or 
environmental stressors \cite{shaham03}. Understanding that a user`s affective
response to cues in the environmental can lead to relapse and drug use are key 
to developing strategies for prevention and treatment.

\subsection{Review of Technology-Based Interventions for Addiction Treatment}

Technology-based interventions have been used for drug addiction assessment, 
treatment, prevention and recovery \cite{marsch12}. In terms of assessment, data 
about individuals substance use can be obtained from mobile cell phone reporting 
outside of treatment settings. Web-based approaches to treatment have been 
implemented online to improve behavioral and psychosocial functioning for addicted 
individuals in recovery \cite{marschdallery2012}. For example, the Therapeutic 
Education System (TES) is a self-directed, web-based interactive treatment program 
consisted of 65 training modules that  focuses cognitive-behavioral skills, 
psychosocial functioning (family/social relations). This online approach helped 
to increase access to treatment for individuals in rural areas, and included an 
optional contingency management module. A computer based Training in Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program was found to enhance treatment outcomes when 
provided in conjunction with traditional substance abuse treatment, and helped 
improve coping skills and decision-making skills \cite{carroll08}. In evaluating 
the effectiveness of mobile applications for addiction treatment, several  
questions remain to be answered: First, if mobile applications primarily are
regarded primarily as supplements to traditional therapeutic treatment, can their 
effectiveness be measured independently from the approach used in treatment? 
Second, over what time period period can the benefits of mobile applications be 
observed? Research evidence suggests that the benefits of mobile interventions 
may be limited to 12 or 15 weeks \cite{swedenson16}. However, it is unclear 
whether individuals struggling from addiction would continue to use mobile 
treatment applications in the long terms, beyond a limited course of treatment.

\subsubsection{Mobile-Based Applications for Addiction Treatment}

Mobile based applications have been used for monitoring and treatment of 
substance abuse and addiction disorders for several decades \cite{boyer10}. 
Early applications included the use of electronic pagers (i.e., ``beepers’’) 
for experience sampling with paper-based assessments that generated data about 
daily life behavior and experiences \cite{swedenson16}. In the 1990s, programmable 
personal digital assistants (i.e., ``palm-pilot’’) enabled collection of data 
electronically, and subsequent mobile research tools facilitated the collection 
of information about psychological factors (e.g., daily stressors, emotional 
states, thoughts) and other variables related to addiction (e.g., craving, 
contextual cues, actual substance use). Assessments performed several times 
throughout the day (commonly, every 2 to 4 hours) allowed for analysis of the 
daily fluctuations of these symptoms and features. Historically, addiction 
research has faced some unique challenges that the use of mobile technologies 
may help to overcome. Methodological aspects of traditional research using 
retrospective, cross-sectional, or longitudinal assessments (over periods of 
weeks, months, or years) have been problematic for investigating risk factors 
including behaviors and symptoms (severe physiological cravings, withdrawal, 
and substance use) that can span a relatively short time. An additional factor 
is the comorbidity, or co-occurence, of substance use disorders (SUDs) with other 
psychological disorders, such as anxiety and mood disorders. For example, the 
``self-medication’’ model has commonly been used to explain the association 
between alcohol abuse is used as an effort by an individual to reduce or cope 
with a high degree of anxiety (or depression). It has also been challenging 
for researchers to capture the role of environmental or contextual cues (e.g., 
people, places, things) associated with substance abuse and addiction, which 
can trigger relapse for individuals in recovery.

\subsubsection*{Smartphone Application for Addiction and recovery}

Continued care is an important ingredient for recovery from addiction that
involves monitoring, outreach, planning, case management, and social support 
\cite{johnson11}. Smartphone applications can help individuals in recovery to 
monitor cravings at critical points in daily life, track contextual cues 
associated with substance use, and provide outreach to support services. A team 
of researchers at the University of Wisconsin evaluated the effectiveness of a
smartphone application called Addiction Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support 
System (A-CHESS), designed to provide recovery support patients leaving 
residential alcohol treatment center \cite{gustafson14}. A-CHESS provided anytime, 
anywhere access to support services in audio-visual format, GPS monitoring and 
warnings for risky locations, and communication with counselors. Over an 8-month
period and 4 month follow-up, patients who used the A-CHESS intervention reported
fewer risky drinking days, on average, per month than patients in a comparable
control group. The findings provide evidence that the smartphone intervention was 
effective at treating a critical behavioral measure for treatment of alcohol use 
disorder (AUD).

\appendix

We include an appendix with common issues that we see when students
submit papers. One particular important issue is not to use the
underscore in bibtex labels. Sharelatex allows this, but the
proceedings script we have does not allow this.

When you submit the paper you need to address each of the items in the
issues.tex file and verify that you have done them. Please do this
only at the end once you have finished writing the paper. To d this
cange TODO with DONE. However if you check something on with DONE, but
we find you actually have not executed it correcty, you will receive
point deductions. Thus it is important to do this correctly and not
just 5 minutes before the deadline. It is better to do a late
submission than doing the check in haste.

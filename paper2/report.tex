\section{Introduction}

Wearables and the Internet of Things for Health, 

In the increasingly connected digital age, personal electronic devices are 
generating tremendous volumes of data with important applications for 
health analytics. Wearable electronic sensors (i.e., \emph{wearables}) and
fitness monitors (e.g, FitBit, iWatch) can record our movements and vital 
physiological measures such as heart rate, temperature, and blood pressure 
\cite{metcalf16}. Consumers are using wearables to self-monitor stress 
and hypertension. In addition, wearable sensors can be used to help track
recovery following medical procedures such as surgery \cite{atallah11}. 
Emerging forms of personalized health care are arising in which individuals 
self-monitor and manage their own health in partnership with care providers.

\subsection{Drug Addiction as an Illness}

For millions of people struggling with substance abuse and dependency in 
the U.S., addiction and relapse are chronic health conditions \cite{boyer10}. 
Drug addiction has many similar characteristics to other chronic medical 
illnesses; however, there are unique challenges to the treatment of addiction
illnesses. For example, drug addicted patients undergo intense detoxification 
in rehabilitation treatment programs, but then are released back into the same 
environment associated with their drug use. The lack of continuity in the 
treatment of addiction disorders, leaves addicts in recovery at high risk for
relapse into substance use and abuse. Second, individuals with addiction 
disorders present for care to emergency rooms after acute intoxication, often 
following law enforcement interventions. Emergency personal and very capable 
at crisis intervention for drug overdose, but lack resources to evaluate severe 
addiction disorders or provide follow-up. Furthermore, addicted individuals 
seeking treatment often relapse at night or on weekends when treatment centers 
are not open. Various theories of addiction and relapse have been proposed. 
According to the classical conditioning model, situational cues or events can 
elicit a motivational state underlying relapse to drug use. A slightly more 
complex model suggests that addictive behavior can be reinstated after 
extinction of dependency by exposure to drugs, drug-related cues, or 
environmental stressors \cite{shaham03}. Understanding that a user`s affective
response to cues in the environmental can lead to relapse and drug use are key 
to developing strategies for prevention and treatment. 



Mobile health applications (i.e., \em{apps}) have been used for public health
education, remote monitoring, data collection, diagnostics, in the treatment
of Drug Abuse and Addiction \cite{boyer10}.

\subsection{Opioid Addiction Interventions}

In Figure \ref{f:fly} we show a fly. Please note that because we use
just columwidth that the size of the figure will change to the
columnwidth of the paper once we change the layout to final. CHnaging
the layout to final should not be done by you. All figures will be
listed at the end.

When copying the example, please do not check in the images from the
examples into your images directory as you will not need them for your
paper. Instead use images that you like to include. If you do not have
any images, do not dreate the images folder.

\subsection{Wearable Sensors}

In case you need to create tables, you can do this with online tools
(if you do not mind sharing your data) such as
\url{https://www.tablesgenerator.com/} or other such tools (please
google for them). They even allow you to manage tables as CSV.

%ate them by hand while using the provided template in Table\ref{t:mytable}. 
Not ethat
the caption is before the tabular environment.

  support and suggestions to write this paper.

\appendix

We include an appendix with common issues that we see when students
submit papers. One particular important issue is not to use the
underscore in bibtex labels. Sharelatex allows this, but the
proceedings script we have does not allow this.

When you submit the paper you need to address each of the items in the
issues.tex file and verify that you have done them. Please do this
only at the end once you have finished writing the paper. To d this
cange TODO with DONE. However if you check something on with DONE, but
we find you actually have not executed it correcty, you will receive
point deductions. Thus it is important to do this correctly and not
just 5 minutes before the deadline. It is better to do a late
submission than doing the check in haste.

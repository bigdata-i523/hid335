\section{Introduction}

Wearables and the Internet of Things for Health, \cite{atallah11, metcalf16}

In the increasingly connected digital age, personal electronic devices are 
generating tremendous volumes of data with important applications for 
health analytics. Wearable electronic sensors (i.e., \emph{wearables}) and
fitness monitors (e.g, FitBit, iWatch) can record our movements and vital 
physiological measures such as heart rate, temperature, and blood pressure 
\cite{metcalf16}. Consumers are using wearables to self-monitor stress 
and hypertension. In addition, wearable sensors can be used to help track
recovery following medical procedures such as surgery \cite{atallah11}. 
Emerging forms of personalized health care are arising in which individuals 
self-monitor and manage their own health in partnership with care providers.








\subsection{Drug Addiction as an Illness} \cite{boyer10}

For millions of people struggling with substance abuse and dependency in 
the U.S., addiction and relapse are chronic health conditions \cite{boyer10}. 
Drug addiction has many similar characteristics to other chronic medical 
illnesses; however, there are unique challenges to the treatment of addiction
illnesses. For example, drug addicted patients undergo intense detoxification 
in rehabilitation treatment programs, but then are released back into the same 
environment associated with their drug use. The lack of continuity in the 
treatment of addiction disorders, leaves addicts in recovery at high risk for
relapse into substance use and abuse. Second, individuals with addiction 
disorders present for care to emergency rooms after acute intoxication, often 
following law enforcement interventions. Emergency personal and very capable 
at crisis intervention for drug overdose, but lack resources to evaluate severe 
addiction disorders or provide follow-up. Furthermore, addicted individuals 
seeking treatment often relapse at night or on weekends when treatment centers 
are not open. Various theories of addiction and relapse have been proposed. 
According to the classical conditioning model, situational cues or events can 
elicit a motivational state underlying relapse to drug use. A slightly more 
complex model suggests that addictive behavior can be reinstated after 
extinction of dependency by exposure to drugs, drug-related cues, or 
environmental stressors \cite{shaham03}. Understanding that a user`s affective
response to cues in the environmental can lead to relapse and drug use are key 
to developing strategies for prevention and treatment.

\subsection{Technology-Based Interventions for Addiction }

Technology-based interventions have been used for drug addiction assessment, 
treatment, prevention and recovery \cite{marsch12}. In terms of assessment, data 
about individuals substance use can be obtained from mobile cell phone reporting 
outside of treatment settings. Web-based approaches to treatment have been 
implemented online to improve behavioral and psychosocial functioning for addicted 
individuals in recovery \cite{marschdallery2012}. For example, the Therapeutic 
Education System (TES) is a self-directed, web-based interactive treatment program 
consisted of 65 training modules that  focuses cognitive-behavioral skills, 
psychosocial functioning (family/social relations). This online approach helped 
to increase access to treatment for individuals in rural areas, and included an 
optional contingency management module. A computer based Training in Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program was found to enhance treatment outcomes when 
provided in conjunction with traditional substance abuse treatment, and helped 
improve coping skills and decision-making skills \cite{carroll08}.

\subsubsection{Mobile Health Applications for Treating Addiction}

Mobile based applications have been used for monitoring and treatment of substance 
abuse and addiction disorders for several decades. Early applications included the 
use of electronic pagers (i.e., ``beepers’’) for experience sampling with paper-
based assessments that generated data about daily life behavior and experiences 
\cite{swedenson16}. In the 1990s, programmable personal digital assistants (i.e.,
``palm-pilot’’) enabled collection of data electronically, and subsequent mobile 
research tools facilitated the collection of information about psychological 
factors (e.g., daily stressors, emotional states, thoughts) and other variables 
related to addiction (e.g., craving, contextual cues, actual substance use). 
Assessments performed several times throughout the day (commonly, every 2 to 4 
hours) allowed for analysis of the daily fluctuations of these symptoms and 
features. Historically, some unique challenges of addiction research have made 
the feasibility of mobile technology somewhat challenging. Methodological aspects 
of traditional research using retrospective, cross-sectional, or longitudinal 
assessments over periods of weeks, months, or years, have been problematic for 
investigating risk factors including behaviors and symptoms, such as severe 
physiological cravings, withdrawal sensations, and substance use, that can span 
a relatively short time period. An additional factor is comorbidity, or 
``co-occurence’’ of substance use disorders (SUDs) with other psychological 
disorders, such as anxiety and mood disorders. For example, the ``self-medication’’ 
model is commonly used to explain the association between alcohol abuse is used as 
an effort by an individual to reduce or cope with a high degree of anxiety (or 
depression). It has also been challenging for researchers to capture the role 
of environmental or contextual cues (e.g., people, places, things) associated with
substance abuse and addiction, which can trigger relapse for individuals in 
recovery.

















Mobile health applications (i.e., apps) have been used for public health
education, remote monitoring, data collection, diagnostics, in the treatment
of Drug Abuse and Addiction \cite{boyer10}.

just columwidth that the size of the figure will change to the

In case you need to create tables, you can do this with online tools
(if you do not mind sharing your data) such as

google for them). They even allow you to manage tables as CSV.

We include an appendix with common issues that we see when students
submit papers. One particular important issue is not to use the
underscore in bibtex labels. Sharelatex allows this, but the
proceedings script we have does not allow this.

When you submit the paper you need to address each of the items in the
issues.tex file and verify that you have done them. Please do this
only at the end once you have finished writing the paper. To d this
cange TODO with DONE. However if you check something on with DONE, but
we find you actually have not executed it correcty, you will receive
point deductions. Thus it is important to do this correctly and not
just 5 minutes before the deadline. It is better to do a late
submission than doing the check in haste.

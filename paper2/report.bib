\section{Introduction}

In the increasingly connected digital age, personal electronic devices are 
generating huge volumes of data with important applications for health analytics. 
Wearable electronic sensors (i.e., \emph{wearables}) and fitness monitors 
(e.g, FitBit, iWatch) can record our movements and vital physiological measures 
such as heart rate, temperature, and blood pressure \cite{metcalf16}. Consumers 
are using wearables to self-monitor stress and hypertension, and wearable sensors 
can be used to help track recovery following medical procedures such as surgery 
\cite{atallah11}. The development of personalized health care models are also 
enabling individuals to self-monitor and manage their own health in partnership 
with care providers. This paper explores approaches to using personal electronic 
devices and wearable sensors for the treatment of addiction disorders and the 
prevention of drug overdose. Past research has shown that \emph{Mobile Health} 
platforms have been used to address prescription medication abuse in several ways: 
(a) monitor patient health conditions at any time and remotely, (b) monitor 
medication consumption, and (c) connect patients with health care providers and 
treatment services \cite{Varshney14}. The following review of the literature shows 
that wireless digital technologies and smartphone applications are effective 
at providing health data in real time and can assist patients in recovery to 
resist physical cravings, prevent relapse, and access treatment support. 
Mobile applications can play an important role in addressing the opioid epideic 
by supplementing traditional approaches to addiction treatment and recovery.

\subsection{The Opioid Epidemic: Medication Abuse and Addiction} 

The abuse of prescription opioid medication in the U.S. has become a major health 
crisis that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has described as an 
epidemic \cite{volkow14}. Approximately 2 million Americans were dependent on 
or abused prescription opioids (e.g., oxycodone, hydrocodone) in 2014 \cite{cdc17}. 
Overdose deaths from prescription opioids has quadrupled since 1999, resulting in 
more than 180,000 deaths between 1999 to 2015. Figure 1 shows that the dramatic 
increase in overdose deaths in the U.S. between 2000 and 2016 are from synthetic 
opioids (other than methadone), natural and semi-synthetic opioids, and heroin 
\cite{nida17}. Of the estimated 64,000 drug overdose deaths in 2015, over 20,000 
were from fentanyl and other synthetic opioid analogs. Public health agencies 
are implementing comprehensive efforts to address four major risk areas of
prescription opioid abuse, overdoses, and deaths: (i) Increasing knowledge of 
opioid abuse and improving decisions among medication prescribers, (ii) Reducing 
inappropriate access to opioids, (iii) Increasing effective overdose treatment, 
(iv) Providing substance-abuse treatment to persons addicted to opioids. The 
nature of the opioid epidemic is complex, and to understand how technological 
interventions can play a role in mitigating the crisis, it is necessary to 
consider the nature of addiction and approaches to treatment.

\subsubsection{Drug Addiction and Treatment}

For millions of people struggling with substance abuse and dependency in 
the U.S., addiction and relapse are chronic health conditions \cite{boyer10}. 
Drug addiction has many similar characteristics to other chronic medical 
illnesses; however, there are unique challenges to the treatment of addiction
illnesses. For example, drug addicted patients undergo intense detoxification 
in rehabilitation treatment programs, but then are released back into the same 
environment associated with their drug use. The lack of continuity in the 
treatment of addiction disorders, leaves addicts in recovery at high risk for
relapse into substance use and abuse. Second, individuals with severe addiction 
disorders end up at emergency rooms for care following acute intoxication, 
often after law enforcement interventions. Emergency personal are capable with
crisis interventions for drug overdose, but lack resources to evaluate severe 
addiction disorders or provide follow-up. Furthermore, addicted individuals 
seeking treatment often relapse at night or on weekends when treatment centers 
are not open. Various theories of addiction and relapse have been proposed. 
According to the classical conditioning model, situational cues or events can 
elicit a motivational state underlying relapse to drug use. A slightly more 
complex model suggests that addictive behavior can be reinstated after 
extinction of dependency by exposure to drugs, drug-related cues, or 
environmental stressors \cite{shaham03}. Understanding that a user`s affective
response to cues in the environmental can lead to relapse and drug use are key 
to developing strategies for prevention and treatment. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Technology-Based Interventions for Addiction Treatment}

Technology-based interventions have been used for drug addiction assessment, 
treatment, prevention and recovery \cite{marsch12}. In terms of assessment, data 
about individuals substance use can be obtained from mobile cell phone reporting 
outside of treatment settings. Web-based approaches to treatment have been 
implemented online to improve behavioral and psychosocial functioning for addicted 
individuals in recovery \cite{marschdallery2012}. For example, the Therapeutic 
Education System (TES) is a self-directed, web-based interactive treatment program 
consisted of 65 training modules that  focuses cognitive-behavioral skills, 
psychosocial functioning (family/social relations). This online approach helped 
to increase access to treatment for individuals in rural areas, and included an 
optional contingency management module. A computer based Training in Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program was found to enhance treatment outcomes when 
provided in conjunction with traditional substance abuse treatment, and helped 
improve coping skills and decision-making skills \cite{carroll08}. In evaluating 
the effectiveness of mobile applications for addiction treatment, several  
questions remain to be answered: First, if mobile applications primarily are
regarded primarily as supplements to traditional therapeutic treatment, can their 
effectiveness be measured independently from the approach used in treatment? 
Second, over what time period period can the benefits of mobile applications be 
observed? Research evidence suggests that the benefits of mobile interventions 
may be limited to 12 or 15 weeks \cite{swedenson16}. However, it is unclear 
whether individuals struggling from addiction would continue to use mobile 
treatment applications in the long terms, beyond a limited course of treatment.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Mobile-Based Applications}

Mobile based applications have been used for monitoring and treatment of
substance abuse and addiction disorders for several decades \cite{boyer10}. 
Early applications included the use of electronic pagers (i.e., beepers) 
for experience sampling with paper-based assessments that generated data about 
daily life behavior and experiences \cite{swedenson16}. In the 1990s, 
programmable personal digital assistants (e.g., palm-pilot) enabled collection 
of data electronically, and subsequent mobile research tools facilitated the 
collection of information about psychological factors (e.g., daily stressors, 
emotional states, thoughts) and other variables related to addiction (e.g., 
craving, contextual cues, actual substance use). Assessments performed several 
times throughout the day (commonly, every 2 to 4 hours) allowed for analysis of 
the daily fluctuations of these symptoms and features. Historically, addiction 
research has faced some unique challenges that the use of mobile technologies 
may help to overcome. Methodological aspects of traditional research using 
retrospective, cross-sectional, or longitudinal assessments (over periods of 
weeks, months, or years) have been problematic for investigating risk factors 
including behaviors and symptoms (severe physiological cravings, withdrawal, 
and substance use) that can span a relatively short time. An additional factor 
is the co-morbidity, or co-occurence, of substance use disorders (SUDs) with 
other psychological disorders, such as anxiety and mood disorders. For example, 
the ``self-medication’’ model has commonly been used to explain the association 
between alcohol abuse is used as an effort by an individual to reduce or cope 
with a high degree of anxiety (or depression). It has also been challenging 
for researchers to capture the role of environmental or contextual cues (e.g., 
people, places, things) associated with substance abuse and addiction, which 
can trigger relapse for individuals in recovery.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Smartphone Applications}

Continued care is an important ingredient for recovery from addiction that
involves monitoring, outreach, planning, case management, and social support 
\cite{johnson11}. Smartphone applications can help individuals in recovery to 
monitor cravings at critical points in daily life, track contextual cues 
associated with substance use, and provide outreach to support services. A team 
of researchers at the University of Wisconsin evaluated the effectiveness of a
smartphone application called Addiction Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support 
System (A-CHESS), designed to provide recovery support patients leaving 
residential alcohol treatment center \cite{gustafson14}. A-CHESS provided anytime, 
anywhere access to support services in audio-visual format, GPS monitoring and 
warnings for risky locations, and communication with counselors. Over an 8-month
period and 4 month follow-up, patients who used the A-CHESS intervention reported
fewer risky drinking days, on average, per month than patients in a comparable
control group. The findings provide evidence that the smartphone intervention was 
effective at treating a critical behavioral measure for treatment of alcohol use 
disorder (AUD). The methods described in this study could be extended by 
re-purposing built-in smartphone sensors to record physiological measures 
related to opioid usage, and communicate data to health care providers or 
treatment specialists to initiate interventions for opioid addiction
\cite{johnson11}.

\subsection{Medication Adherence and Abuse Monitoring System}

Mobile health applications can be used to monitor medication adherence and 
as an advanced warning system for potential abuse of prescription medication 
\cite{varshney13}. Medication abuse can consist of higher medication dosages 
or rapid escalation of a prescribed dosage, and the general goal of a prediction 
model is to analyze patient data for sudden changes in medication consumption. 
Figure 2 illustrates several steps in a process and decision support structure 
for a medication monitoring system, with adjustable parameters, such as the 
threshold for abuse (e.g., greater than N doses in X hours) \cite{Varshney14}. 
A major challenge for measuring medication abuse is obtaining reliable 
information from potentially addicted individuals based on self report data. 
Ideally, information on medication consumption and adherence can be obtained 
from multiple sources. Addiction is a complex behavior that involves a variety 
of factors, including: demographics (e.g., age, gender), past history, 
comorbidity with other disorders, family support, social influence, employment 
status, and patient motivation. Figure 3 shows a model architecture of a system 
for monitoring potential abuse where dose information is provided via a 
smartphone application, relayed via wireless cellular network to analytic models 
that measure changes in medication consumption, relays reports to support 
treatment services for possible interventions, and to a smart medication box that 
dispenses medication. In order to function successfully a medication abuse 
monitoring system depends on the collection of reliable information, including 
data from wearable sensors that can directly measure physiological changes 
(e.g., heartrate, blood pressure, respiration, temperature) related to changes 
in medication usage. In the context of prescription opioid abuse, such as 
medication monitoring system could be very beneficial in anticipating opioid 
addiction and preventing overdose death.

\subsection{Mobile Detection with Wearable Biosensors}

Portable biosensors can provide a continuous stream of data on the timing, 
location, context, and duration of drug use by individuals in treatment. 
In a small pilot study, researchers used an Affectiva Q sensor to measure 
electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature, and acceleration (8 recordings 
per second), in a sample of N = 4 patients during the administration of opioid 
medication in an emergency room setting \cite{carreiro15}. Table 1 provides a 
summary of the participant characteristics. The biosensor was worn on the 
wrist and is similar in size and dimensions to a wristwatch or fitbit health
monitor. The results showed an increase in EDA associated with intravenous 
opioid injection that was detected by the biosensors. In addition, there was 
some indication that the physiological response to opioids varied according 
to individual drug tolerance. The findings provide evidence to support the 
use of wearable biodensors to detect drug use in real time, though in a 
relatively controlled environment. An important limitation of the study is 
the small sample size, which reduces the generalizability of the findings to 
a broader population. The authors also acknowledged that psychological or 
physiological stress can produce alterations in EDA, skin temperature, and 
acceleration, and therefore this could not be ruled out as an alternative 
explanation for the findings. The results are promising, however, and encourage 
future efforts to explore the effectiveness of wearable biosensors in the 
context of environments that individuals in recovery associate with drug use 
where relapse can occur.

\subsection{Emerging Sensor Technologies}

Wearable wireless sensors have been used to study physiological responses, 
activity, and social behavior in non-human primates, in the form of a fitted 
vest, and using a mobile phone with blue tooth protocol to collect data 
in real time. Figure 4 shows sample ambulatory data from a rhesus macaque
recorded from a wearable wireless sensor for 11 hours inside a large group 
primate cage \cite{fletcher12}. Data was recorded on a custom Android software 
application, which captured measures of EDA, heart rate (HR), temperature, and 
acceleration. The goals of this study were to measure associations between 
physiological measures and social behavior in primates; however, this practical 
application of sensor technology demonstrated a system that was relatively 
low-cost, highly portable, scalable, and simple to use. Future research could 
explore the development of a similar system modified for use with humans to 
collect data on physiological measures from addicted individuals in naturalistic 
settings.
